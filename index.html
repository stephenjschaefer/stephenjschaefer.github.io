        <h3><a id="1/14/2016" class="anchor" href="#1/14/2016" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>January 14th, 2016</h3>
        <p>I've finished the initial release of a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> implementation of the 15 position triangle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire">peg solitaire</a> game often found at Cracker Barrel. To implement different data structures valid moves are stored in an <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html">array</a> and the peg jumped by those valid moves is stored in a <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Hash.html">hash</a>, allowing for a list of valid moves for a given board state to be presented to the user for reference while playing. The application also makes use of the <a href="http://rubytree.anupamsg.me/">RubyTree</a> gem to recursively build a solution tree in order to determine if a given board configuration can be solved such that there is only one peg remaining, providing the user feedback to guide them to a solution while playing. The <a href="https://github.com/stephenjschaefer/PegSolver">source</a> is available in my public GitHub repository and I've pushed the application to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and it's available to play at the following <a href="https://fierce-lake-6111.herokuapp.com">URL</a>.</p>

        <h3><a id="1/4/2016" class="anchor" href="#1/4/2016" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>January 4th, 2016</h3>
        <p>I wanted to try out the <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> platform's <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> DBaaS <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/cleardb">add on</a> offered through <a href="https://www.cleardb.com/">ClearDB</a>, so I decided to stand up an instance of the popular <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a> based <a href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/">Coppermine Photo Gallery</a>. The photo gallery can be accessed via this <a href="https://mysterious-tor-4005.herokuapp.com/index.php">link</a> however due to Heroku's non-persistent file system that is recreated each time a dyno is restarted no user photos are uploaded yet. I've added the <a href="https://github.com/stephenjschaefer/APlusPhotography">source</a> to GitHub as I plan to modify the code to either store images in the database directly rather than storing a file path reference to the image or instead leverage <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> for persistent storage of uploaded images. I'm also going investigate what changes would be required in order to make <a href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/">CPG</a> compatible with the latest <a href="http://php.net/archive/2015.php#id2015-12-17-1">PHP 7.0.1</a> release which updates the supported <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mysql.php">PHP MySQL Drivers</a>, removing the original <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysql.php">MySQL</a> extension that <a href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/">CPG</a> currently uses in favor of the new <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php">MySQLi</a> extension.</p>

        <p>Who remembers when <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/en/">Oracle Application Express</a> was called HTMLDB? I do! I also remember being excited about setting up an instance of Application Express at home after APEX was included in <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/overview/index.html">Oracle XE</a>. While doing some hard drive house cleaning for the new year I found a mock APEX reservation system I had previously created for the fictitious "Hotel Express" hotel chain. I was curious how APEX 5 would handle an older application so I imported it into my hosted workspace and was surprised by how smooth the process was. After importing the application, performing the available updates and fixing a few issues the application is available <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=11592">here</a>.</p>

        <p>I've created a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">Java</a> version of the classic board game Mastermind using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)">Swing</a> to build the Graphical User Interface. The project includes <a href="http://stephenjschaefer.github.io/Mastermind/javadoc/index.html">Javadocs</a> and <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> unit tests and uses <a href="https://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> for dependency management and build processes. The project <a href="https://github.com/stephenjschaefer/Mastermind">source</a> is available in my <a href="https://github.com/stephenjschaefer">GitHub</a> public repository and I've also created a <a href="http://stephenjschaefer.github.io/Mastermind">Mastermind Project Page</a> that contains additional details along with a link to play the game by launching a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/signindex.html">signed</a> executable JAR file using <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/javaws/">Java Web Start</a>.</p>

        <p>Merry Christmas to all! In keeping with the holiday, I've uploaded the <a href="https://github.com/stephenjschaefer/Christmas-FizzBuzz">source</a> for a quick FizzBuzz solution written in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> with a Christmas twist.</p>

        <p>I've uploaded the latest <a href="https://github.com/stephenjschaefer/MMCd">source</a> to one of my favorite projects - a Palm OS based OBD-I automotive diagnostic and datalogging application known as "Mitsubishi Motor Corporation datalogger", or MMCd for short. This project combined some of my favorite interests and was my first experience doing mobile development. MMCd was originally authored by <a href="mailto:yurtaev@users.sourceforge.net">Dmitry Yurtaev</a> with additional contributions made by <a href="mailto:spoulson2@users.sourceforge.net">Shawn Poulson</a>, <a href="mailto:cbatters@users.sourceforge.net">Clinton Battersby</a> and <a href="mailto:schaefer.steve@gmail.com">I</a>. MMCd is written in C and is built using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin,</a> <a href="http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/">prc-tools,</a> and <a href="http://pilrc.sourceforge.net/">pilrc</a> in a Windows environment. Additional details about the communication protocol used and hardware compatibility are available on the sourceforge <a href="http://mmcdlogger.sourceforge.net/">project page</a> created by Dmitry. My involvement in the project started with v1.6p, where Clint and I worked together to fix bugs and implement new features which were well received by the 3SI user community as detailed in this <a href="http://www.3si.org/forum/f35/mmcd-new-features-203226/">thread</a> on 3SI.org.</p>

        <p>I've started working on developing my personal GitHub page to be able to showcase personal projects. As the code for this website evolves, it will be available for review in my public GitHub repository located <a href="https://github.com/stephenjschaefer/stephenjschaefer.github.io">here</a>.</p>
